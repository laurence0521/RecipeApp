This is a collaborative project for EC327: Software Engineering at Boston University

We started with C++ and are moving to implementing the android back-end entirely in Java code. This should accomplish
the following goals:

1) To speed up compiling time
2) Simplify the debugging process
3) Shorten the coding time
4) See more immediate results
